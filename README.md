## Description of our Project:

This project is based on the data collected by the Frail Safe Project and our goal was to provide a detailed analysis on them. The datasets provided
were two discrete ones. The first one is the clinical dataset, containing information which was collected during the clinical evaluation elderly
people from medical experts. This information represents the clinical status which lead in the seperation of 3 classes: frail, pre-frail and non frail.
The second dataset named beacons dataset, contains information of the movement of the elderls in their home setting with daily records.

## The Goal:

More specifficaly the goal can be splitted into 3 discrete parts:

- Preprocess the clinical dataset and provide one or more classification models.
- Preprocess the beacons dataset, merge the two processed datasets and provide one or more clustering models.
- Provide an exploratory analysis with various visualization techniques,
